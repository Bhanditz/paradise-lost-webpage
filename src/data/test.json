There was a place,\r\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\r\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\r\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\r\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\r\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\r\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\r\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\r\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\r\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\r\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\r\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\r\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\r\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\r\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\r", "O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\r\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n  For what God after better worse would build?\r\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\r\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\r\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\r\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\r\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\r\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\r\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\r\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\r\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\r\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\r\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\r\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\r\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\r\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\r\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\r\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\r\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\r\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\r\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\r\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\r\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\r\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\r\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\r\n  Exalted from so base original,\r\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\r\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\r\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\r\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\r\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\r\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\r\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\r\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r", "So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\r\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\r\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\r\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\r\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\r\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\r\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\r", "ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\r\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\r\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\r\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\n  For while so near each other thus all day\r\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\r", "O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\r\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\r\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\r\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\r\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\r\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\r\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\r\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\r\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\r\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\r\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\n  May have diverted from continual watch\r\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\r\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\r\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\r\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\r\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\r\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\r\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\r\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\r\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\r", "So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\r\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\r\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\r\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\r\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\r\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\r\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\r\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r", "Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\r\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\r\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\r\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\r\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\r\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\r\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\r\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\r\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\r\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\r\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r", "Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\r\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\r\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\r\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\r\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\r"],

There was a place,\r\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\r\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\r\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\r\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\r\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\r\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\r\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\r\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\r\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\r\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\r\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\r\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\r\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\r\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\r", "O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\r\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n  For what God after better worse would build?\r\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\r\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\r\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\r\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\r\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\r\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\r\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\r\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\r\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\r\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\r\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\r\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\r\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\r\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\r\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\r\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\r\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\r\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\r\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\r\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\r\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\r\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\r\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\r\n  Exalted from so base original,\r\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\r\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\r\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\r\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\r\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\r\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\r\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\r\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r", "So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\r\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\r\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\r\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\r\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\r\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\r\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\r", "ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\r\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\r\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\r\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\n  For while so near each other thus all day\r\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\r", "O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\r\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\r\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\r\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\r\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\r\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\r\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\r\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\r\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\r\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\r\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\n  May have diverted from continual watch\r\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\r\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\r\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\r\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\r\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\r\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\r\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\r\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\r\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\r", "So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\r\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\r\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\r\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\r\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\r\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\r\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\r\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r", "Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\r\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\r\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\r\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\r\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\r\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\r\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\r\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\r\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\r\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\r\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r", "Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\r\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\r\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\r\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\r\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\r"],

There was a place,\r\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\r\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\r\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\r\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\r\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\r\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\r\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\r\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\r\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\r\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\r\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\r\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\r\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\r\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\r", "O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\r\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n  For what God after better worse would build?\r\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\r\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\r\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\r\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\r\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\r\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\r\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\r\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\r\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\r\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\r\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\r\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\r\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\r\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\r\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\r\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\r\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\r\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\r\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\r\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\r\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\r\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\r\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\r\n  Exalted from so base original,\r\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\r\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\r\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\r\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\r\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\r\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\r\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\r\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r", "So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\r\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\r\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\r\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\r\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\r\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\r\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\r", "ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\r\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\r\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\r\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\n  For while so near each other thus all day\r\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\r", "O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\r\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\r\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\r\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\r\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\r\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\r\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\r\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\r\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\r\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\r\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\n  May have diverted from continual watch\r\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\r\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\r\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\r\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\r\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\r\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\r\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\r\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\r\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\r", "So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\r\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\r\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\r\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\r\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\r\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\r\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\r\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r", "Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\r\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\r\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\r\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\r\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\r\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\r\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\r\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\r\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\r\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\r\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r", "Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\r\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\r\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\r\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\r\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\r"],

Why should not Man,\r\n  Retaining still Divine similitude\r\n  In part, from such deformities be free,\r\n  And for his Makers Image sake exempt?\r", "O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\r\n  That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\r\n  Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\r\n  Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;\r\n  And put to proof his high Supremacy,\r\n  Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\r\n  Too well I see and rue the dire event,\r\n  That with sad overthrow and foul defeat\r\n  Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host\r\n  In horrible destruction laid thus low,\r\n  As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences\r\n  Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\r\n  Invincible, and vigour soon returns,\r\n  Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state\r\n  Here swallow'd up in endless misery.\r\n  But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\r\n  Of force believe Almighty, since no less\r\n  Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)\r\n  Have left us this our spirit and strength intire\r\n  Strongly to suffer and support our pains,\r\n  That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\r\n  Or do him mightier service as his thralls\r\n  By right of Warr, what e're his business be\r\n  Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\r\n  Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\r\n  What can it then avail though yet we feel\r\n  Strength undiminisht, or eternal being\r\n  To undergo eternal punishment?\r\n  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.\r", "He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\r\n  Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\r\n  The sound of blustring winds, which all night long\r\n  Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\r\n  Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\r\n  Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\r\n  After the Tempest: Such applause was heard\r\n  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,\r\n  Advising peace: for such another Field\r\n  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\r\n  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL\r\n  Wrought still within them; and no less desire\r\n  To found this nether Empire, which might rise\r\n  By pollicy, and long process of time,\r\n  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.\r\n  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,\r\n  SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave\r\n  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd\r\n  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and publick care;\r\n  And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\r\n  Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood\r\n  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear\r\n  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\r\n  Drew audience and attention still as Night\r\n  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\r", "So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;\r\n  For neither Man nor Angel can discern\r\n  Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks\r\n  Invisible, except to God alone,\r\n  By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth:\r\n  And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps\r\n  At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie\r\n  Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill\r\n  Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd\r\n  URIEL, though Regent of the Sun, and held\r\n  The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n;\r\n  Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule\r\n  In his uprightness answer thus returnd.\r\n  Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know\r\n  The works of God, thereby to glorifie\r\n  The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess\r\n  That reaches blame, but rather merits praise\r\n  The more it seems excess, that led thee hither\r\n  From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,\r\n  To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps\r\n  Contented with report heare onely in heav'n:\r\n  For wonderful indeed are all his works,\r\n  Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all\r\n  Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;\r\n  But what created mind can comprehend\r\n  Thir number, or the wisdom infinite\r\n  That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.\r\n  I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,\r\n  This worlds material mould, came to a heap:\r\n  Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar\r\n  Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd;\r\n  Till at his second bidding darkness fled,\r\n  Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:\r\n  Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then\r\n  The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,\r\n  And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n\r\n  Flew upward, spirited with various forms,\r\n  That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs\r\n  Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;\r\n  Each had his place appointed, each his course,\r\n  The rest in circuit walles this Universe.\r\n  Look downward on that Globe whose hither side\r\n  With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;\r\n  That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light\r\n  His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere\r\n  Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon\r\n  (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide\r\n  Timely interposes, and her monthly round\r\n  Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n;\r\n  With borrowd light her countenance triform\r\n  Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,\r\n  And in her pale dominion checks the night.\r\n  That spot to which I point is PARADISE,\r\n  ADAMS abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.\r\n  Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.\r", "To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:\r\n  URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight,\r\n  Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,\r\n  See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass\r\n  The vigilance here plac't, but such as come\r\n  Well known from Heav'n;

under his burning Wheeles\r\n  The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,\r\n  All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon\r\n  Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand\r\n  Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent\r\n  Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd\r\n  Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,\r\n  All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;\r\n  O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode\r\n  Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\r\n  That wish'd the Mountains now might be again\r\n  Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.\r\n  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell\r\n  His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,\r\n  Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,\r\n  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,\r\n  One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye\r\n  Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\r\n  Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,\r\n  And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,\r\n  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.\r\n  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd\r\n  His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant\r\n  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:\r\n  The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard\r\n  Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd\r\n  Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd\r\n  With terrors and with furies to the bounds\r\n  And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,\r\n  Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd\r\n  Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight\r\n  Strook them with horror backward, but far worse\r\n  Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw\r\n  Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth\r\n  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.\r", "So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,\r\n  With HALLELUIAHS: Thus was Sabbath kept.\r\n  And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd\r\n  How first this World and face of things began,\r\n  And what before thy memorie was don\r\n  From the beginning, that posteritie\r\n  Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst\r\n  Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.\r", "To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd.\r\n  Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond\r\n  Compare above all living Creatures deare,\r\n  Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd\r\n  How we might best fulfill the work which here\r\n  God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass\r\n  Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found\r\n  In woman, then to studie houshold good,\r\n  And good workes in her Husband to promote.\r\n  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd\r\n  Labour, as to debarr us when we need\r\n  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,\r\n  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\r\n  Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\r\n  To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,\r\n  Love not the lowest end of human life.\r\n  For not to irksom toile, but to delight\r\n  He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.\r\n  These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt\r\n  Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\r\n  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long\r\n  Assist us: But if much converse perhaps\r\n  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.\r\n  For solitude somtimes is best societie,\r\n  And short retirement urges sweet returne.\r\n  But other doubt possesses me, least harm\r\n  Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst\r\n  What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe\r\n  Envying our happiness, and of his own\r\n  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\r\n  By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\r\n  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\r\n  His wish and best advantage, us asunder,\r\n  Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\r\n  To other speedie aide might lend at need;\r\n  Whether his first design be to withdraw\r\n  Our fealtie from God, or to disturb\r\n  Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\r\n  Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;\r\n  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\r\n  That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.\r\n  The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\r\n  Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\r\n  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.\r", "Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud\r\n  Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,\r\n  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\r\n  Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\r\n  Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\r\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\r\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\r\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\r\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\r\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\r\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\r\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\r\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\r\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\r\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\r\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\r\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\r\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\r\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r"],

Can thus\r\n  Th' Image of God in man created once\r\n  So goodly and erect, though faultie since,\r\n  To such unsightly sufferings be debas't\r\n  Under inhuman pains?

Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\r\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\r\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\r\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\r\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\r\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\r\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\r\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\r\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\r\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\r\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\r\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\r\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\r\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\r\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r"],

Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\r\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\r\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\r\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\r\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\r\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\r\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\r\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\r\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\r\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\r\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\r\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\r\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\r\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\r\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r"],
